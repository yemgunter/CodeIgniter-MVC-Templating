                    <h2>This assignment was challenging!</h2>

                    <p>Although I have plenty of experience working on the back end coding of CMSs like:</p>
                    <ul>
                    <li>Joomla!
                    <li>Drupal
                    <li>WordPress
                   </ul>

                    <p>This was my first exploration of CodeIgniter. There was much research to complete on this CMS outside of following 
                    <br>the handy User Guide which included; reading a number of articles and watching hours of videos, 
                    <br>which all helped me with this project.</p>
